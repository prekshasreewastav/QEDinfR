#' Banking Failures During the Great Depression
#'
#' During the early great depression, the St. Louis Fed in the 8th Federal Reserve District was anti-interventionist,
#' while the Atlanta Fed in the 6th Federal Reserve District was an advocate for helping
#' banks in need. Mississippi was divided in half by these districts, with it's southern
#' half in Atlanta's 6th District, and the upper half in St. Louis's 8th district.
#' This data describes the number of banks in business over time in the 6th and 8th Federal
#' Reserve Districts.
