# QEDinfR

QEDinfR offers simple tools to facilitate the use of basic quasi-experimental designs for causal inference in observational settings including Greedy Matching methods (with Mahalanobis distances or Propensity Scores), Regression Discontinuity, and Differences-in-Differences. This package was built as an educational tool primarily for the students of QAC307: Experimental Design and Causal Inference, a course taught by Prof. Valerie Nazzaro at the Quantitative Analysis Center, Wesleyan University.
