# Basic Example Code

\code{QEDinfR} provides functions which make basic Difference in Differences designs easy and quick. After specifying your model, the plot method for \code{qed_did} objects quickly creates counterfactual outcome plots which motivate these designs..

```{r setup}
library(QEDinfR)
data(banks)
```

First we run the example code model.

```{r}
fit <- qed_did("num_banks_in_business", "year", 1930,  "bank_district", "6th district", df = banks)
summary(fit)
```
