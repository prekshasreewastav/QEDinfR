# Basic Example Code

\code{QEDinfR} provides functions which make basic Regression Discontinuity designs easy and quick. After specifying your model, the plot method for \code{qed_rdd} objects quickly creates the standard graph which motivates simple regression discontinuity designs.

```{r setup}
library(QEDinfR)
data(mlda)
```

Here we specify the model from the example code, and call the summary function. The data is from a study on the effect of minimum legal drinking age laws, where the discontinuity is at age 21

```{r}
fit <- qed_rdd("all", "agecell", 21, mlda)
summary(fit)
```

And then the graph method:

```{r}
plot(fit)
```
